#### A [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template for creating a custom Python extension with xtensor

## What is xtensor-python-cookiecutter?

`xtensor-python-cookiecutter` helps extension authors create Python extension modules making use of xtensor.

It takes care of the initial work of generating a project skeleton with

- A complete `setup.py` compiling the extension module
- A few examples included in the resulting project including

    - A universal function defined from C++
    - A function making use of an algorithm from the STL on a numpy array
    - Unit tests
    - The generation of the HTML documentation with sphinx

## Usage

Install [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter):

    $ pip install cookiecutter

After installing cookiecutter, use the xtensor-python-cookiecutter:

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtensor-python-cookiecutter.git

As xtensor-python-cookiecutter runs, you will be asked for basic information about
your custom extension project. You will be prompted for the following
information:

- `author_name`: your name or the name of your organization,
- `author_email`: your project's contact email,
- `github_project_name`: name of the GitHub repository for your project,
- `github_organization_name`: name of the GithHub organization for your project,
- `python_package_name`: name of the Python package created by your extension,
- `cpp_namespace`: name for the cpp namespace holding the implementation of your extension,
- `project_short_description`: a short description for your project.
  
This will produce a directory containing all the required content for a minimal extension
project making use of xtensor with all the required boilerplate for package management,
together with a few basic examples. The generated Python extension requires an installation
of  `xtensor` `^0.18.0`, `xtensor-python` `^0.21.0`, `numpy`, and `pybind11` `^2.1.0`.

Install the module:

    $ pip install ./{{ cookiecutter.github_project_name }}/


If you have [Jupyter](jupyter.org) installed, run the [Test_Run notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/xtensor-stack/xtensor-python-cookiecutter/blob/master/Test_Run.ipynb):

    $ cd {{ cookiecutter.github_project_name }}
    $ jupyter notebook
